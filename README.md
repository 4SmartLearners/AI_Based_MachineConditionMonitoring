This code reads machine health data (vibrations, level, motor amplitude, parts per minute) and performs machine condition monitoring to prevent jams.

Data Collection: The data is collected from accelerometers, ultrasonic sensors, voltage-current sensors, and inductive sensors.

Data Preprocessing: The data is examined for missing values, outliers, and scaled.

Exploratory Data Analysis: The data is visualized using graphs, charts, and statistical analysis is performed.

Feature Engineering: Features are scaled using a standard scalar.

Model Selection: Four classification models are selected: (1) SVM, (2) Random Forest, (3) Multilayer Perceptron, and (4) GBDT.

Model Training: Gridsearch and cross-validation are used to find the best hyperparameters. The models are then re-trained with those hyperparameters.

Model Evaluation: The models' performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, AUC-ROC, and F1-score.

Model Optimization: The models are fine-tuned to improve performance.

Model Deployment: The best model will be deployed using Databricks and AWS in a production environment to make predictions on new, unseen data. A pipeline will be created.

Model Maintenance: The models' performance will be continuously monitored, and retraining will be carried out as new data becomes available. Necessary adjustments will be made.
